# React-frontend

This is the frontend application of my solution, a
web application that interacts with user, facilitating
image upload, listing images and geting detailed information
with insights on the selected image,

## Install

### pre-requisites

To run this application, the user must have **Node** version > `16`.
I am using `v18.17.0`, so that is an idea case.

Simple install, just use

```shell
npm install
```
